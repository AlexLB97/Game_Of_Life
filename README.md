# Game_Of_Life
Matlab implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

This implementation of Conway's Game of Life allows the user to choose between randomly generating a starting population of a certain size and density, importing a
text file as the starting configuration, or starting with an empty grid and using the cursor to add to the population. The mouse can also be used at any time to add or 
remove organisms from the board. 

The user also has the option to advance the evolution of the board by any increment they choose on each click of the next button.
